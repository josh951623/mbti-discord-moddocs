Mod Guidelines
==============
Confidentiality
---------------
Topics discussed in the channels marked staff/staff-log/the-council, as well as all PM conversations, are by default confidential. If anything discussed in those channels needs to be made public, the staff or council (depending on the channel) can hold a vote to make it so. Anything discussed in PM will only become public if BOTH parties give permission for it to be shared. The staff/council has to include the act of giving permission when they are sharing parts of discussions.

Procedures
==========
Community feedback on future and present issues
-----------------------------------------------
All members of #staff naturally talk to a given number of community members. Whenever an important issue comes up (e.g. punishment of a member, rule violation or change, etc), or barring that at least once a week, all staff members are encouraged to bring up server concerns to everyone they already talk with in casual conversation. 

To make sure every member of the community is reached, staff are encouraged to list the names of user's they've at least spoken with about the issue. Any members of the community who have yet to be contacted can then be reached out to by volunteers among staff, either in public channels or PM.

When discussing feedback from users, staff members should divorce the specific idea or concern from the user who brought it up as a matter of confidentiality. Who said it is not as important as the idea itself.

Community feedback on past issues and decisions
-----------------------------------------------
Members of Staff should only speak publically or in PM about matters that were decided and acted upon if they can do ALL of the following:

1. State only hard facts about the case 
2. Not mention any staff member by name, even themselves, or their particular role in decisions made
3. When asking for feedback, can keep it to "what do you think and how could we have done it better?"
4. Not be provoked into justifying or giving reasons for any decisions made when given said feedback

Often a user will have strong feelings about a subject and may not be the most diplomatic in communicating their concerns, so if a staff member can't compensate by maintaining neutrality and politeness, it's best that they avoid the issue in the first place, or barring that, politely disengage saying "Thank you for your input" and walk away.
