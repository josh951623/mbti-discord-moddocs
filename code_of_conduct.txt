**Reporting**
If there is an issue you have on the server, weather that be with a specific member, or with how things are run, please PM one of us. We want to hear your voice and we cannot fix problems we are unaware of. If your problem deals with a specific event, screen-shots or at least the place and approximate time (with time-zone) would be appreciated for context. 

**Rule Enforcement:    ___T H I S   I S   A   B I G   D E A L!!!!___**
Staff have the power to enforce rules as they see fit. These are not hard and fast rules so much as guidelines **which are open for interpretation by staff**.

**Rules**
1. Do not upload, post,  request, or link to anything that violates local or United States law.

2. Do not give out personal information (dox) others, nor harass them for such information about either themselves or others.

3. NSFW content is restricted to the channels explicitly marked as such. Please respect that some people are at work when they are logged on. Exceptions exist for truth questions/answers.

4. Flaming/trolling or generally causing unnecessary friction between community members is disallowed. 

5. Remember that MBTI does not define a person. Do not impose or project stereotypes based on type.

6. What happens in #feels stays in #feels. Don't be an asshole in #feels. Violation of this rule WILL lead to a channel-ban, possibly a server-ban.

7. All off-topic discussion in #council-chamber will be removed, and excessive violation of this rule can lead to channel-bans.

#lobby - Landing page for new members and a general hangout for everyone

#feels - Discussion channel for serious or private matters, or just a pick-me-up after a bad day. We moderate this channel more strictly in regards to behaviour, and want it to be a safe place for you to talk. As a result, new members are not immediately granted permission to access it.
