===Things to be discussed:===
- Logging culture
- Dealing with personal bias
- How serious staff mis-steps should be handled
- What justifies a ban
- What justifies a warning
- Channel purposes
- Adding mods

===Friction===
- Intentional AND malicious [towards the individual, not idea] degradation of a person's feelings, reputation, self-worth, opinions, or believes.
- Frequent disregard for the feelings of others

===General guideline===
Do not to feed into drama, or take sides on things if possible. Understand when you have, or may be bias, and be able to take a step back or inform the rest of staff of this bias if at all possible so it might be taken into account.

===Warning===
What you say, in any context, is the words of a moderator. You may intend for them to come from you as a member, but they will rarely, if ever, be seen as such. Take heed of this in all your interactions.
Responding to PMs and reports
Be diplomatic, and ensure them that it will be taken seriously and discussed with other staff. Be wary of promising any more than mentioning and “looking into it”.

When logging the PM, you simply need to state that someone had mentioned something to you, and your thoughts on it, should you like. Further discussion will ensue in the meeting-room. For example: “X said Z about Y. Personally I think W about the situation”.

_The opinion on the matter is good, not only as a frame of reference, but also as a starting point for conversation, or a point of contention, that will generate productive debate on how to handle the situation._
